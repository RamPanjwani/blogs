This one is gonna be short, as it is my first blog. Also I wanted to take a cool looking screenshot is the reason I am typing.

Making this website was pretty easy. Even a non-technical person can do it.

You only need two things for this to work: [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
